## Aim: To develop a prompt-based application using ChatGPT - To demonstrate how to create a prompt-based application to organize daily tasks, showing the progression from simple to more advanced prompt designs and their corresponding outputs.

## AI Tools Required: 
ChatGpt<br>


# Explanation: 
## Prompt:
"Design a personal productivity assistant that can help manage daily tasks, schedule reminders, suggest wellness tips, and answer general queries. The assistant should interact using natural language and be adaptable to the user’s changing preferences over time."
## Procedure:
1. Define the core requirements of a personal productivity assistant.
2. Identify and construct appropriate prompts for each task using an LLM (e.g., ChatGPT).
3. Simulate natural user interaction through a simple interface or command-line system.
4. Collect feedback or inputs from users and adapt responses accordingly.
5. (Optional) Integrate basic memory to simulate preference adaptation.

## EXPECTED OUTPUT: - (attached the drive link)
Output (Example Response by LLM):
Personal Productivity Assistant Features:
1. Daily Task Manager:
o Accept tasks via natural language (e.g., "Remind me to call mom at 6 PM").
o Organize tasks by priority and deadline.
o Provide daily summaries and pending items.
2. Smart Scheduler:
o Schedule events and set reminders using contextual understanding.
o Notify user of overlapping appointments or free time slots.
3. Wellness Tips Generator:
o Suggest daily wellness advice (hydration, exercise, screen-time breaks).
o Adapt suggestions based on past user preferences and responses.

## Key Features:
1. Natural Language Processing<br>
i)Understands conversational commands like "add task", "remind me", "show my progress"<br>
ii)Interprets intent from various phrasings<br>
iii)Responds contextually to user queries<br>

2. Task Management<br>
i)Add, complete, and delete tasks<br>
ii)Priority levels (high, medium, low)<br>
iii)Visual completion tracking<br>
iv)Persistent storage across sessions<br>

3. Smart Reminders<br>
i)Time-based reminders with natural language ("remind me in 2 hours")<br>
ii)Automatic notifications when reminders trigger<br>
iii)Tracks upcoming and past reminders<br>

4. Wellness Integration<br>
i)Provides random wellness tips (hydration, breaks, exercise)<br>
ii)Customizable wellness focus in preferences<br>
iii)Break reminders based on user preferences<br>

5. Productivity Insights<br>
i)Real-time completion statistics<br>
ii)Progress tracking with encouraging feedback<br>
iii)Visual dashboard with quick stats<br>

6. Adaptive Learning<br>
i)Saves user preferences (work hours, wellness focus, task priorities)<br>
ii)Adjusts behavior based on user interactions<br>
iii)Persistent storage remembers everything between sessions<br>

7. General Q&A<br>
i)Powered by Claude AI for answering general questions<br>
ii)Context-aware responses<br>
ii)Falls back gracefully if API unavailable<br>

## PROMPT-2 (With enhancements):
```
Create a TODO based app for organizing the daily tasks which enhanced with the buttons such clear tasks,add,status of tasks,date and make a stylish interface by applying css and javascript.
```

## PROMPT-3 (More better enhancements):
```
Build a motivation based todo full fledged application where users feel rewarded after every time they completed tasks by increase their XP points and also track the performance of users. Show their results and performance in better visualization by using piechart,graph. Make the interface more better to look than the previous.
```
